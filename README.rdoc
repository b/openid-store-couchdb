== openid-store-couchdb

A CouchDB association/nonce store for OpenID

== CouchDB setup

The CouchDB store requires 2 databases to function: associations and nonces.  Both must be available at the same base URI, generally meaning on the same server, and must have the same credentials for the username/password of the OpenID consumer client.
